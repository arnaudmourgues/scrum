AbstractSentence compression holds promise for many applications ranging from summarizationto subtitle generation. Our work views sentence compression as an optimization problemand uses integer linear programming (ILP) to infer globally optimal compressions in thepresence of linguistically motivated constraints. We show how previous formulations ofsentence compression can be recast as ILPs and extend these models with novel globalconstraints. Experimental results on written and spoken texts demonstrate improvementsover state-of-the-art models.

Sentence Compression for Automated Subtitling: A Hybrid ApproachVincent Vandeghinste and Yi PanCentre for Computational Linguistics
Katholieke Universiteit LeuvenMaria Theresiastraat 21BE-3000 LeuvenBelgiumvincent.vandeghinste@ccl.kuleuven.ac.be, yi.pan@ccl.kuleuven.ac.beAbstractIn this paper a sentence compression tool is described. We describe how an input sentence getsanalysed by using a.o. a tagger, a shallow parserand a subordinate clause detector, and how, basedon this analysis, several compressed versions of thissentence are generated, each with an associated estimated probability. These probabilities were estimated from a parallel transcript/subtitle corpus. Toavoid ungrammatical sentences, the tool also makesuse of a number of rules. The evaluation was doneon three different pronunciation speeds, averagingsentence reduction rates of 40% to 17%. The number of reasonable reductions ranges between 32.9%and 51%, depending on the average estimated pronunciation speed.

AbstractWhen humans produce summaries of documents, theydo not simply extract sentences and concatenate them.Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture themost salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstractpairs are available online, it is now possible to envisionalgorithms that are trained to mimic this process. Inthis paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achievetwo goals simultaneously: our compressions should begrammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conﬂict. We devise both noisy-channel and decision-treeapproaches to the problem, and we evaluate resultsagainst manual compressions and a simple baseline.
